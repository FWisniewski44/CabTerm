My own codebook: vars from Saalfeld (2008), as they were coded in the data frames (Bergmann et al. and ERDDA). For future reference.

# Most recent developments, thoughts - notice
+ Joined data frames not perfect: atm just glued together somehow...
+ Two separate dfs to be made in the future
  + First df filtered for minor_coalition and post_election_cabinet
  + Second df filtered for one_party_minor and post_election_cabinet
  + Why this way? - check for differences in stability: are minority coalitions more stable? Or are no coalition agreements and such needed for a minority cabinet to work (i. e. one party minority cabinets that have to fight for their respective majorities on bills etc.)

# ***STRUCTURE***
_______________________________

+ majority cabinet (NOT NEEDED)
+ cabinet seat share (*erdda*: v318e)
+ number of cabinet parties (*dtaBerg*: num_cabparties)
+ minimal winning status (NOT NEEDED)
+ party with max. bargaining power is in cabinet (*erdda*: v322e or bpmaxcab)
+ coalition cabinet (*erdda*: v329e, recode to: govtype) ????
+ maximum possible cabinet duration (*dtaBerg*: max_dur; *erdda*: v305e)
+ effective number of parliamentary parties (*dtaBerg*: eff_numb_parties, *erdda*: v309e)

#######################

# ***PREFERENCES***
_______________________________

+ cabinet preference range (*dtaBerg*: polarization_bpw, rl_polar, many more; *erdda*: v410e - this is exactly the pref range of the cab)
  + there are *several preference ranges in Bergmann et al.*, maybe this could be interesting?
  + otherwise: DO NOT INCLUDE, bc. pref range of minority cabs is not that important, bc. they always need external support

+ minimal connected cabinet (*NOT NEEDED*)
+ median party (1st dimension) in cabinet (*erdda*: v411e)
+ conservative cabinet (*dtaBerg*: gov_comp for gov composition; *erdda*: v415e)
  + optional: *dtaBerg*: right_vote or right_seat - vote/seat share of right wing parties (also conservatives?)
+ socialist cabinet (*dtaBerg*: gov_comp, *erdda*: v416e)
  + optional: *dtaBerg*: comm_vote or comm_seat - vote/seat share of communist parties
+ parliamentary preference range (*dtaBerg*: rl_range, *erdda*: v406e)
+ polarization (bp weighted) (*dtaBerg*: polarization_bpw, *erdda*: v407e)
+ effective number of issue dimensions (*?????*)
+ extremist party seat share (not explicitly found, maybe via *dtaBerg*: antisys_seat)

#######################

# ***INSTITUTIONS***
_______________________________

+ length of CIEP (????)
+ positive parliamentarism (dtaBerg: positive_parl; erdda: v505e, recode to invest)
+ *opposition influence (???? --> which data set was used in saalfeld 08? apparently strøm, bergman and müller had their own, which was used by saalfeld, but where to find this? --> via erdda website: proble)*
+ cabinet rule: unanimity (*erdda*: v509e, recode to: cabunan)
+ PM powers (1-7 scale) (*erdda*:v513e, recode to: pmpow)
+ PM dissolution powers (*dtaBerg newer via Goplerud/Schleiter-index 2016*: pm_diss_pow)
+ bicameralism (*dtaBerg*: bicameralism; *erdda*: v504e)
+ semi-presidentialism (*dtaBerg*: semi_presidentialism; *erdda*: v518e, recode to: semip)

#######################

# ***BARGAINING*** (especially here, the other df by Strøm, Bergmann, Müller would be needed - but it is from 2008 until max. 2012)
_______________________________

+ existence of coalition agreement (*????*)
+ comprehensive policy agreement (*????*)
+ coalition discipline in legislation (*????*)
+ same PM and cabinet (*dtaBerg*: same_pm)
+ cabinet bargaining duration (*dtaBerg*: cab_barg_duration; erdda: v600e)
+ coalition cabinet (erdda: v329e, recode to: govtype)
+ majority cabinet (*NOT NEEDED*)
+ max. possible cabinet duration (*dtaBerg*: max_dur; *erdda*: v305e)

# ***CRITICAL EVENTS***
_______________________________

+ electoral volatility (previous election) (*erdda*: v700e, v701e)
+ inflation (time varying) (*erdda*: beginning == v702e; end == v706e)
  + may need some calculation; e. g. the difference of the two vars
+ unemployment (time varying) (*erdda*: beginning == v703e; end == v705e)
  + can be seen together with inflation as *proxies for economic performance* of cabs
  + just like inflation values, some further calculations could be of use
+ interaction effects??? (in Saalfeld's study, there were interactions between soc. governments##unemployment and cons. governments##inflation)


# ***DEPENDENT VAR AND MISC***
_______________________________

+ *discr2019* --- discretionary cabinet terminations (2019)
  + code: 1 == discretionary ; 0 == others
+ for event history analysis/data over time: abs_dur --- absolute duration (days)
+ filtered vars are one_party_minor and minor_coalition (filter for minority cabinets only) and post_election_cabinet (cabinets after elections at the end of legislative periods)

<!-- # independent vars (based on Saalfeld 2008) -->

<!-- ## eff_numb_parties --- effective number of parties -->
<!-- ### based on Laakso/Taagepera index (1979) -->

<!-- ## cab_barg_duration --- cabinet bargaining duration -->
<!-- ### measured in days -->

<!-- ## pm_diss_pow --- Prime Minister dissolution powers -->
<!-- ### index from 0-10 based on Goplerud/Schleiter 2016 -->
<!-- ### additionally: look up what Saalfeld was using in 2008 -->

<!-- ## rl-range --- overall parliamentary RILE range -->
<!-- ### range = maximum - minimum; higher values = more RILE polarization -->
<!-- ### this is for the parliament as a whole - is another polarization var needed just for the cab? -->
<!-- #### possibility to merge *erdda* variable for this into *dtaBerg*? -->

<!-- ## polarization_bpw --- polarization (bp weighted) -->
<!-- ### polarization of cabinets, value as calculated in *erdda* 2014, hence also only data for countries from *erdda* -->
<!-- ### rather include this for cabinet preference range? (in *erdda*: v407e - combined DF has this too) -->
